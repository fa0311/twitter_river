# twitter_river(Beta)

## what is this

A client for Twitter using an unofficial API.  
This was created in defiance of the deliberate suspension of Twitter's official API.

[The Morning After: Twitter may have deliberately cut off third-party app access](https://www.engadget.com/the-morning-after-twitter-may-have-deliberately-cut-off-third-party-app-access-121551679.html)  
[Twitter admits it’s breaking third-party apps, cites ‘long-standing API rules’](https://www.engadget.com/twitter-third-party-app-developers-api-rules-193013123.html)

Because we reverse-engineer Twitter's WEb client and use a private API, there is no concern that the authentication token will be suspended.  
This application does not infringe Twitter copyright.  
Currently under development and most features are not yet implemented.

See [roadmap](https://github.com/fa0311/twitter_river/issues/1) for details.
